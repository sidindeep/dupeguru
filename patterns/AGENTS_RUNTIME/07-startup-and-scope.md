## Scope And Startup Behavior

- Treat short greetings, thanks, acknowledgements, and status-neutral messages
  as no-ops unless they include an explicit task, path, command, error, or
  project question. Do not run startup restore or read project files for those
  messages; reply briefly and ask what the user wants to do next.
- For each new project session, require a clear, measurable project goal before
  implementation begins.
  - If no explicit project goal exists in startup artifacts or user text,
    ask for it in the next response and pause implementation planning.
  - Help user formulate it by asking 1-3 focused questions (target user,
    expected outcome, success criteria).
  - Confirm the final goal wording and continue only after confirmation.
- Track the agreed goal during the thread.
  - Reference it in first planning reply and after major changes.
  - In final output, report completion status against each goal criterion and
    list any remaining gap as a clear blocker.
- For `gi start`, `gi restore`, and title-only first messages, restore only the
  minimum orientation needed for the next turn: local instructions, latest
  summary metadata or relevant sections, and compact git state. Do not read full
  summaries, runbooks, memory notes, logs, or diffs unless a concrete task needs
  them.
- Treat `gi start sprint`, `gi sprint start`, and equivalent active-sprint
  wording as more specific than plain `gi start`: route them through the
  configured task-manager workflow, not generic startup restore.
- Do not treat remembered plans, old refactoring phases, stale task notes, or
  local commits ahead of a remote as the next action during `gi start` or
  `gi restore`. Mention them only as compact context when relevant, then ask for
  the user's current task instead of offering to continue, run, push, or finish
  them.
- Treat `init <source>`, `инит <source>`, and `инициализируй <source>` that
  point to the canonical shared-instruction Git repository
  `https://github.com/Dimosfil/general-instructions.git`, the current
  shared-instruction checkout/cache, `GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_HOME`, or another
  known shared-instruction source as a shared-instruction bootstrap/startup
  request, even without the `gi` prefix.
  Read the repository's local instructions and follow the documented `gi`
  bootstrap rules. Do not reinterpret that form as Git initialization, OpenCode
  setup, project creation, or skill creation unless the user explicitly names
  that action.
  Treat `инит правила <source>` the same way when `<source>` points to
  `general-instructions`. Examples such as
  `инит <path-to-general-instructions>` and
  `инит правила <path-to-general-instructions>` mean "load or initialize
  instruction rules from the existing shared-instruction source"; they never
  mean `git init`. Do not create folders, initialize `.git`, or suggest
  `npm init` / `python -m venv` for this form.
- Treat screenshots, logs, pasted errors, or other bug evidence as requests for
  analysis first. Explain the likely issue and ask what action the user wants
  before editing files, unless the user explicitly says to fix it, such as
  `fix`, `почини`, or `gi почини`.
- When the user explicitly says to fix an issue, treat that as approval to take
  required low-risk implementation and verification actions without an extra
  confirmation prompt, including rebuilding, restarting the affected local
  process, or closing a currently running app window that blocks single-instance
  verification. Still ask before destructive actions, possible data loss,
  credential or secret handling, external system changes, or unrelated scope.
- When a user provides a PDF path or attachment and asks to inspect, verify, or
  reread it, read the actual PDF before relying on memory, chat fragments, or
  screenshots. First confirm the file exists and page count/metadata when cheap,
  then try local text extraction with available PDF tools or libraries. On this
  Windows setup, if plain `python` is blocked by user-profile AppData access,
  prefer `uv run --with pypdf python -c "..."` as a non-project fallback for
  extracting page text without changing repository dependencies. If extracted
  text is empty or clearly incomplete, treat the PDF as possibly scanned and
  ask before using OCR, network services, installing tools, or writing extracted
  content to the repository. Summarize only task-relevant findings and avoid
  printing full private documents by default.
- Ask before expanding into unrelated scope. Proceed without asking only when
  the expansion is required for the stated goal and remains low-risk.
- When preparing a project for a repository, publishing to GitHub, or removing
  "unneeded" files, do not classify `AGENTS.md`, `tools/`,
  `tools/project-memory/`, `skills/`, bootstrap scripts, update scripts, deploy
  scripts, or agent-facing instruction/config files as removable only because
  they look internal or tool-related. Inspect their purpose first and treat them
  as possible RAG/startup infrastructure. Delete them only when the user
  explicitly confirms they are temporary or unrelated to the project.
- During repository cleanup, classify SQLite and database files before acting.
  Do not delete or commit `*.sqlite`, `*.sqlite3`, or `*.db` files solely
  because they are binary or local-looking. Keep generated agent-memory indexes
  such as `tools/project-memory/project_memory.sqlite` ignored when they are
  rebuildable, and commit the reviewable README, Markdown/JSON memory exports,
  schema, and indexing scripts instead. Do not commit databases containing
  secrets, private data, telemetry, task-manager state, absolute local paths, or
  agent conversation history.
- Treat this repository root as the filesystem boundary for normal work. Do not
  read, search, edit, create, delete, move, or inspect files in another project
  or arbitrary external folder unless the user gives an explicit concrete path
  and action. Communicate with other projects through documented APIs,
  connectors, or task-manager endpoints.
- Treat `.\others\` under the current workspace parent, or another
  project-local relative path named by local instructions, as the standard local
  parent folder for third-party projects, cloned external repositories, and
  vendor experiments when no more specific destination is provided. This default
  folder is configurable: if the user gives another path or project-local
  instructions define another third-party workspace parent, use that instead. Do
  not mix third-party projects into the current project workspace.
