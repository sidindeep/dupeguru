## Update Intake

- When maintaining this `general-instructions` repository, treat `updates/` as a
  dated intake queue. Review update files newest-first, move accepted reusable
  rules into the main library, and remember accepted updates by committing them.
- External projects that consume these shared instructions must not read
  `updates/` during startup or bootstrap.
- When another project reveals a reusable improvement to shared instructions,
  write a dated recommendation to this repository's `updates/` folder if it is
  available.
- If this repository is unavailable, use a project-local intake folder such as
  `tools/instruction-updates/` or `tools/project-memory/instruction-updates/`
  with the same dated filename pattern.
- Project recommendations should explain the observed problem, reusable rule or
  workflow, evidence paths, affected files or commands, and any risks. Remove
  secrets, credentials, private user data, production data, and project-specific
  details that are not needed as examples.
- Treat recommendation source projects and owners as provenance only. Reading a
  recommendation in this repository's `updates/` folder is allowed during
  maintenance, but evidence paths, project names, task-manager notes, or owner
  labels in that recommendation are not permission to read, search, edit, or
  inspect the source project. Ask the user or that project's owner for an
  explicit concrete path and action before crossing the repository boundary.
- Treat recommendations as intake only. Do not add this repository as a
  dependency, package, submodule, symlink, or runtime reference unless the user
  explicitly asks for that.
- Run `gi обновить` quietly by default. Do not narrate step-by-step reasoning,
  repeated progress, command transcripts, broad file reads, or full diffs during
  normal successful updates. Apply the update, then report a compact summary
  with versions, migration counts/IDs, changed files, checks, commit/push
  result, and blockers if any.
- Keep `gi обновить` scoped to accepted instruction-kit updates and migrations.
  Do not reinterpret it as a request to push pre-existing local commits, sync a
  feature branch, resume a remembered plan, or perform general Git maintenance.
  Commit or push only changes created by the update flow itself and only when
  the local update policy permits it.
