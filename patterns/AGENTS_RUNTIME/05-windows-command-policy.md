## Windows Command Policy

- Prefer PowerShell-native networking commands such as `Invoke-RestMethod` and
  `Invoke-WebRequest` instead of `curl.exe`.
- Do not probe for `curl.exe` with `where.exe curl` or `Get-Command curl` unless
  the user explicitly asks for curl diagnostics.
- Prefer trusted helper binaries from `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\bin` before
  WindowsApps or System32 shims.
- If Windows or antivirus tools block agent commands with `Access denied`,
  trust narrow agent-owned tool folders such as `.codex\.sandbox-bin\` and
  `.codex\bin\`; do not add broad exclusions for System32 or PowerShell itself.
